Description: ===============================================================
        Python wrapper for Lourakis' sparse bundle adjustment C library 
        ===============================================================
        
        Enjoy! The most recent version can be obtained from bitbucket via::
        
            hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/devangel77b/python-sba
        
        As prerequisites, you will also need to install the sba library as a shared object (libsba.so) (Makefile with shared object target included here) and the sba projections library (libsbaprojs.so)::
        
            http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/sba
            https://bitbucket.org/devangel77b/libsbaprojs
        
        See HOWTO.txt for details. 
        
        Typical usage
        =============
        
        The main way to use this is as follows::
        
            import sba
        
            cameras = sba.Cameras.fromTxt('cams.txt')
            points = sba.Points.fromTxt('pts.txt',cameras.ncameras)
            newcams, newpts, info = sba.SparseBundleAdjust(cameras,points)
        
        If you wish to alter the default and autodetected options, you can
        create an Options object and change it, and then pass it to sba::
        
            options = sba.Options.fromInputs(points,cameras)
            # can also update options.XXX to appropriate values
            newcams,newpts,info = sba.SparseBundleAdjust(cameras,points,options)
        
        Hopefully this is cleaner than the original way to call it in C. 
        
        Helpful Hints
        =============
        
        Some users have used this package in a workflow combined with the CalTech
        Borguet camera calibrations and with data exported from Hedrick's Matlab 
        dltDV5 / easyWand5 tools.  If decomposing someone else's P matrix for use
        as a cams.txt, it may help to remember that rotations and translations here 
        are in the world frame; Rc=R', Tc-R*t (using notation of Hartley and 
        Zisserman).
        
        When building for a Mac, one user (amin_abouee) noted that the extensions 
        should be .dylib rather that .so; this can be fixed by altering the lines 
        in both the Makefiles and the code, e.g.:
        
            libsba = ctypes.CDLL("libsba.dylib")
        
        On rotations: AndyLJones noted the following "SBA works with two sets of rotations. There's the initial rotations, which are fed in as part of the globs argument of sba_motstr_levmar_x and family in libsba. These are fixed throughout the optimization. There're also the "local rotations", as Lourakis's readme calls them, which are fed in with the rest of the camera parameters via the p argument to the same function. These are updated at each step. Internally, libsba uses local_rotation * initial_rotation when figuring out the projections." This becomes important if you are working on a known-rotation problem and wish to specify initial rotations. See Issue #16 for more detail.

        The original sba C library was written by Manolis Lourakis and is 
        described in Lourakis, Manolis I A and Antonis A Argyros (2004), "The design 
        and implementation of a generic sparse bundle adjustment software package 
        based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm", FOURTH_ICS TR-340.
